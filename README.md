### Upcoming features
- Contact me page: To safely send me an email with details
- "Just for fun": An interactive page with some mini-games, portfolio websites don't have to be boring after all!
- Easter eggs: I'll keep this one a secret to myself for now :)
- Web Hosting: So a pre-built production page is available, can't always rely on everyone to run my code.
- Light/Dark mode toggle: A way to change between themes

### To do

- Code Cleanup
    - This is in a very early stage of development, a lot of LESS, CSS and JS cleanup to be made, along with proper commenting
    - Automated testing. A full automated testing suite is required, along with coverage tools and a continous pipeline for full safety
    - More descriptions on my work and projects, along with a showcase of skills.
